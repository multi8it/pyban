PyBan - Kanban with Python!

Have you heard of Kanban? No? It's a way of structuring your work - to get
an idea of what needs to be done, to break down a seemingly overwhelming task
into smaller, more managable tasks.

Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban if you want to read more about it.

This program is a simple Python script that provides a command line
interface to your own Kanban boards. Not much more than that. Cheers.
